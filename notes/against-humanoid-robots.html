            <h1>Against Humanoid Robots</h1>
            <div class="author">by Ali Taha</div>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>One of the central conversations in robotics is whether the future of robotics lies in humanoid robots or application-specific robots. Before diving into the details of this discussion, I find it helpful to review technology and its evolution at large. To properly deploy a paradigm-shifting technology, there are typically two extreme routes:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>The technology must adapt to the world.</li>
                <li>The world must adapt to the technology.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Examples include technologies as fundamental as roads and cities, electrical grids, lighting, telephones and telegraphs, cars, the internet, mobile apps, and analog ICs.</p>

            <p>In all these cases, an intellectually honest observer would agree that it's a mixture of both: the technology adapts to the world and the world adapts to the technology. In fact, I would go as far as saying that the coexistence of both approaches is inherent to any virtuous cycle and necessary. The question then really comes down to what comes first—the world adapting to the technology or the technology adapting to the world.</p>

            <p>For cars and chariots, the ancients created roads to adapt the environment to their vehicles. In the modern world, people made fortunes setting up internet infrastructure instead of trying to optimize wireless communication first. With transportation, the strategy was: let's make roads for our simple cars, not let's make an all-terrain vehicle first. This is natural because to fuel the growth of technology and stay alive, money is necessary. Without it, the technology goes from helping humanity to becoming a pipe dream—but I digress.</p>

            <p>For computing, a similar story unfolds. Before CPUs could explode into general-purpose platforms, the world had to adapt first. Standards were established—programming languages like FORTRAN and COBOL were developed for specific business needs. Early software deployment came through applications tailored to specific businesses: IBM's mainframes for corporate data processing, specialized systems for banking, payroll management for large corporations. The infrastructure had to be built first—data centers, standardized protocols, business processes redesigned around computational workflows. Only after this foundation was laid and the world had adapted to computational thinking did we see the evolution toward general-purpose platforms. This eventually led to personal computers, the internet, and today's AI and search systems that can handle virtually any task. But it all started with specific applications solving specific problems, not with a general-purpose machine trying to do everything from day one.</p>

            <p>For apps, I'm sure multiple people foresaw that the web could be used to organize car rides and taxis, facilitate communication as Facebook did, and even enable dating. However, again the world was made amenable to these ideas first, and then these ideas came next.</p>

            <h2>The Main Point</h2>

            <p>Coming to the main point regarding robotics: I believe the route will be the same, not different. Before we can get an "all versatile" humanoid robot, we will first have a wave of application-specific robots. The companies that follow this approach will expand and capture market share first. Not only that, but in this market specifically, the data and learning collected through these deployments will give them a competitive edge that could potentially create a monopoly.</p>

            <p>Supporters of humanoid robot adoption typically state the following argument: "The world is designed for humans, therefore to maximize robot adoption and deployment we must create a human." The line of reasoning is acceptable at first glance. However, I will challenge the premise that the "world is designed for humans."</p>

            <p>One of the most defining features of humans is the use and development of tools. In many contexts, the world is designed for the tools that are designed for humans. This observation is why for the vast majority of the trillions of dollars to be captured in the robotics market, designing application-specific robots that resemble the tools humans use but do not require human inputs will be the path forward.</p>

            <p>But there's an even more fundamental issue: the human form factor is simply not optimal for most activities. We are bipedal creatures with limited reach, modest strength, and fragile joints. We need sleep, food, and breaks. Our "design" is a compromise optimized for survival and reproduction, not for industrial efficiency. Why would we constrain a robot to walk on two legs when it could have tank treads? Why give it two arms when it could have six? Why limit its reach to human proportions when it could extend telescopically? The humanoid form factor isn't just a harder engineering challenge—it's often an inferior solution. A humanoid robot trying to lift heavy objects will always be outperformed by a purpose-built lifting robot. A humanoid trying to navigate tight spaces will be beaten by a specialized crawler. The path isn't just easier and faster for application-specific robots; it's also better optimized for actually getting work done.</p>

            <p>To further convince you of this point, consider the following examples of real environments and judge for yourself which strategy is smarter. Note we are purely focused on physical AI.</p>

            <p><strong>ASR = Application-Specific Robot</strong></p>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>1. Agriculture</h2>
                <p><strong>Humanoid Robot Path:</strong> Humanoid robots would walk through fields, manually pick fruit, drive tractors, and perform all farm tasks that human laborers currently do.</p>
                <p><strong>ASR:</strong> Smart tractors with autonomous navigation, specialized fruit-picking robots with custom grippers, automated planting systems, and sensor networks for crop monitoring.</p>
                <p>Agriculture is one of the most automated fields. The agricultural revolution showed us that humans are terribly inefficient compared to machines for these tasks. The magic here for robotics would be going that last mile to eliminate the remaining human workforce. Animal husbandry remains an exception because of ethical considerations and the intricacies of animal behavior—a human-looking robot resembling the farmer may fare better, though I doubt anyone is building humanoid robots for this as a first use case.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>2. Retail & Logistics</h2>
                <p><strong>Humanoid Robot Path:</strong> Humanoid robots would walk through warehouses, grab shopping carts, fill them with items, navigate aisles, and drive forklifts to fulfill orders.</p>
                <p><strong>ASR:</strong> Automated sorting systems, robotic arms on tracks, smart conveyor belts, and autonomous mobile robots designed for specific warehouse tasks.</p>
                <p>The ASR path already works well and reliably—it's present reality, not future fantasy. Third-wave automation, Amazon robotics, and similar companies have solved logistics and 3PL services with few remaining edge cases. The market has already spoken. There's a video of a "Figure AI" robot sorting packages, but Amazon robotics accomplished this 5-6 years ago and uses it in production—all you need is a robot arm on a platform, not the full humanoid package.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>3. Hospitality</h2>
                <p><strong>Humanoid Robot Path:</strong> Humanoid robots would walk hotel corridors, clean rooms like human housekeepers, carry trays for room service, and cook in kitchens using human tools and techniques.</p>
                <p><strong>ASR:</strong> Roomba-style floor cleaners, automated bed-making systems, smart coffee machines, robotic dishwashers, and specialized bathroom cleaning robots.</p>
                <p>The tasks here are mostly cleaning rooms, room service, and cooking. For cooking, the path mirrors the coffee machine evolution—we don't need a robot arm to open cabinets and stir cups; we design machines where you put a cup in and the machine handles everything. For cleaning, it makes much more sense to deploy a Roomba than teach a humanoid robot to untangle wires. Cleaning bathrooms and waste management has been solved by robots like Somatic robotics. The remaining tasks like making beds and folding towels are difficult, but the bar for excellence is higher for humanoid robots than for specialized plug-and-play systems.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>4. Medicine</h2>
                <p><strong>Humanoid Robot Path:</strong> Humanoid robots would perform surgery with human-like hands, walk through hospitals, and operate medical equipment designed for human use.</p>
                <p><strong>ASR:</strong> da Vinci surgical systems, automated MRI machines, specialized diagnostic robots, and purpose-built medical devices with integrated AI.</p>
                <p>The market is crystal clear here: da Vinci and Intuitive Surgical dominate. Nobody wants thick robot fingers performing delicate surgery. For scanning, we put patients in purpose-built MRI machines. The medical field has already chosen precision-engineered tools over human-mimicking alternatives.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>5. Manufacturing</h2>
                <p><strong>Humanoid Robot Path:</strong> Humanoid robots would work assembly lines, operate human-designed machinery, and perform manufacturing tasks using the same motions and tools as human workers.</p>
                <p><strong>ASR:</strong> Robotic assembly arms, automated production lines, smart manufacturing equipment, and purpose-built industrial robots for specific tasks.</p>
                <p>Figure AI and Tesla bots send out videos of robots on manufacturing floors, but I don't see what's necessary about the humanoid form. We already have dark factories in China with full automation. The US and developing countries are some of the few places where manual manufacturing persists. A humanoid robot might be better at glass blowing, but there's no compelling argument for the form factor in most manufacturing contexts.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>6. Defense & Warfare</h2>
                <p><strong>Humanoid Robot Path:</strong> Humanoid robots would carry weapons, operate vehicles designed for humans, and perform reconnaissance missions in human-like fashion.</p>
                <p><strong>ASR:</strong> Autonomous drones, smart missiles, robotic vehicles, enhanced existing weapons platforms, and specialized military robots for specific combat or support roles.</p>
                <p>War has always involved augmenting human limitations—we can't run fast enough, throw far enough, or withstand much damage. Spears, weapons, tanks, planes, drones, and submarines all work effectively. I can put compute modules and sensors on these proven platforms rather than create a humanoid that walks around looking at screens and interpreting results.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>7. Mining & Similar Endeavors</h2>
                <p><strong>Humanoid Robot Path:</strong> Humanoid robots would operate mining equipment, walk through dangerous tunnels, and perform extraction work using human-scale tools and techniques.</p>
                <p><strong>ASR:</strong> Smart excavators, autonomous mining trucks, automated drilling systems, and specialized robots for dangerous underground work.</p>
                <p>We already use massive trucks and excavators for mining. Make these tools smart rather than building a humanoid to operate them. Bigger machines provide more surface area for sensors and are easier to equip with computational systems. The scale advantage is enormous.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>8. Space</h2>
                <p><strong>Humanoid Robot Path:</strong> Humanoid robots would perform spacewalks, operate spacecraft controls, and conduct research using human-designed interfaces and tools.</p>
                <p><strong>ASR:</strong> Specialized space robotics, autonomous satellites, purpose-built research platforms, and integrated spacecraft systems designed for the space environment.</p>
                <p>This remains an interesting case requiring further analysis, as the extreme environment may favor either approach depending on specific mission requirements.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>9. The Trades</h2>
                <p><strong>Humanoid Robot Path:</strong> Humanoid robots would use human tools, navigate job sites, perform electrical work, plumbing, and repairs in existing buildings designed for human workers.</p>
                <p><strong>ASR:</strong> Specialized repair robots, smart building systems, automated maintenance platforms, and purpose-built tools for specific trade tasks.</p>
                <p>This is one of the few fields where I agree that humanoid robotics make sense. The work is so dynamic and unrepeatable, requiring intuition that anything without human-like versatility may fail. But I haven't seen robo-electrician videos because it's incredibly difficult. I think the trades will eventually disappear as buildings get replaced—we can design for robo-repairability the same way we design for manufacturability. Car mechanics would also be nearly impossible to replace with ASRs, but humanoids could work, though it remains technically challenging.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>10. Construction</h2>
                <p><strong>Humanoid Robot Path:</strong> Humanoid robots would use human construction tools, climb scaffolding, and build structures using traditional human construction methods.</p>
                <p><strong>ASR:</strong> Smart excavators, automated concrete pouring systems, robotic welding platforms, 3D printing systems for houses, and specialized construction robots.</p>
                <p>We have large, powerful tools for construction—make the tool smart rather than putting a humanoid operator in it. I can fit more sensors on every joint of an excavator than on a human head. Additionally, 3D printing of houses is emerging as a major trend that completely bypasses the need for human-form construction workers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="conclusion">
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>The pattern is clear across industries: application-specific automation dominates markets long before general-purpose platforms emerge. The companies betting on ASRs will capture the early market share, generate crucial operational data, and build competitive moats that could prove insurmountable for later humanoid robot entrants. While humanoids may eventually have their place in certain niches like the trades, the trillions of dollars in robotics value will be captured first by those who make the world adapt to smart tools, not by those trying to make human-shaped tools adapt to an unchanged world.</p>
