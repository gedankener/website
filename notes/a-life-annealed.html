            <h1>A Life Annealed</h1>

                "One question I have been wrestling with since childhood is how to best live life. The answer is annealing."
            </div>

            <p>Annealing is a concept I was exposed to while interning at Corning Glass. It applies to crystal structures and describes the process by which crystal particles repeatedly undergo controlled heating and cooling cycles. During the heating phase, atoms gain energy and become mobile. This allows them to escape local energy wells—those comfortable but suboptimal positions they've settled into. As the material cools slowly, these atoms have the opportunity to find lower energy states, more stable configurations that would have been impossible to reach without first being heated enough to break free from where they were stuck.</p>

            <p>In an analogous fashion, man and woman must undergo their own annealing. Their composition—thoughts, beliefs, knowledge, career, finances, and experiences—must repeatedly go through cycles of heating and cooling. In an endless march towards completeness, the annealing person sings out of tune. Exploring something they never thought they would. Seeing how some other group of people lives. Today they code, tomorrow they sell, the day after they write, the day after they pick up an instrument. They read philosophy and engineering books and draw parallels across it all. They see the unity of the universe. They see the golden thread that connects Bach and the others, that weaves through everything.</p>

            <p>The reason this is annealing and not just "exploration" and "curiosity" is that in the process one loses and gains energy. You learn something, excel in it, only to be reborn a novice in a different field. You save money just to throw it all on a startup. So you go through cycles and annealing schedules of wealth and energy and expert levels.</p>

            <p>The most fundamental thing that anneals is your worldview. The annealed life, more than anything, gives you an accurate perception of the world. You learn about something and have an experience and your worldview solidifies. Then by "heating"—wildly exploring—your worldview dissolves again. You are left questioning your most fundamental beliefs, only to cool down and reform them stronger than before. These cycles are what perfect a person, their character, and their relationship with the larger world.</p>

            <div class="conclusion">
                <p>So anneal.</p>
